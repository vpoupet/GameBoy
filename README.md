# GameBoy

A Javascript Game Boy emulator. This is mostly a programming exercise to understand the inner workings of the Game Boy and work with some low-level bytes manipulations in JS.

Since there are already hundreds of perfectly functional Game Boy emulators (with dozens in JavaScript) this project has no particular ambition.

## Getting Started

The emulator is supposed to be run in a browser. An up to date *webpack* version is hosted on [this project's Github pages page](https://vpoupet.github.io/GameBoy/).

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to run the project as it can be directly opened [in a browser](https://vpoupet.github.io/GameBoy/).

### Installing

All the JS code is in the `/src` directory. The file `/index.html` executes the script `/dist/main.js` that should be produced by *webpack*.

## Running the tests

There are no tests at the moment
